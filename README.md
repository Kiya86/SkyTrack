# SkyTrack
FPV drone project that can hopefully reach 100 mph with carbon reinforced 3d printed frame. This drone has been an idea of mine for a couple of years now, but due to funding issues, it never really got finalized. I thank Hack Club for making this possible. 

All of the parts I sourced are on AliExpress to keep the cost of the drone down. When comparing to other sources, I found out I can save a lot lol.
